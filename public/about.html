<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Victor Cly Jr., and I currently reside in Mesa, Arizona. I work as an RF/Microwave Engineering Technician. I've been married for 12 years and have 4 children.</p>

<p>My passion for music, particularly Metal, led me to play guitar. My journey into web development began when I was tasked with building a website for my dad's church, which was looking to expand its reach. In a short time, I've become deeply interested and fascinated with web development, and I'm excited to see what the future holds.</p>
